**Title: teachers day poem?**</br>

This is a Story</br>
on my first day at school</br>
i felt nervous</br>
but very very cool</br>
i was very very shy</br>
whenever the sf's asked for a reply</br>
then i saw my ft's</br>
Ms Ng and mdm Sim</br>
the first impressions of them</br>
ms Ng was friendly, and very very kind</br>
Mdm Sim was strict very very strict</br>
when i was asking her for something</br>
i swear i heard</br>
****Oh! Your approaching me?***</br>
although this was later proved false for she is very very, um... </br>
not not kind</br>
The end</br>
